title: Visualizing your configuration

`classy train` has an option that lets you visualize the full materialized configuration in your terminal, showing you 
where each component comes from (including overridden configuration groups, overrides, profiles, etc.). 
To print it, simply append `--print` to your current `classy train` command!
